        <h2>Web Developer</h2>
        <p>
          I work as a web developer for <a href="http://www.vermonster.com">Vermonster, LLC</a>, a Boston-based web design consultancy.
          I specialize in Ruby on Rails and Javascript (ES2015, Ember.js, React/Redux). I also have experience programming
          in Java, C++ and Python. Lately, I have been working with the FHIR standard for transmitting
          electronic health record information.

        <h2>Singer</h2>
        <p>
          I have been singing for as long as I can remember. Most recently, I sang as a member of the tenor sections
          of the <a href="http://www.bso.org/brands/bso/about-us/musicians/tanglewood-festival-chorus.aspx">Tanglewood Festival Chorus</a>
          and <a href="http://www.choruspromusica.org">Chorus Pro Musica</a>. As a recent transplant to Austin, TX,
          I am looking forward to discovering what there is to explore in the choral/classical music scene around town!
        </p>
        <h2>Triathlete</h2>
        <p>
          In 2014, I had a very scary experience swimming in the Stockbridge Bowl in Lenox, MA. Afterwards, I resolved to
          become a better swimmer, and in March of 2015, as a birthday present from my wonderful girlfriend, I began to take
          swimming lessons, and at the same time signed up for my first triathlon (go big or go home). In September of 2015,
          I raced the Buzzards Bay Sprint Triathlon, and after crossing the finish line, I was hooked. Though swimming is still not
          my favorite way to spend an afternoon, I get deep satisfaction from both the process of training and the act of racing.
